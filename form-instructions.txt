These are instructions for creating a react component that uses the NEF web components.

• Create a typescript type that represents a User entity, the shape would look something like the
following:

type User = {
    id: number;
    name: string;
    username: string;
    email: string;
    phone: string;
    website: string;
}


• Create a form using NEF components create a new user.
• Forms should have labels that make sense based on the entity that we are creating
• There should be a submit button that appears that will submit the form
• The "website" field will have a list of valid string values and we thus want this to be a select rather than
a simple text box. Use the NEF Select component for this
• Use fetch to call the appropriate endpoints in JSONPlaceholder for /user
• Post when you are creating a new user
• Form Validation
• Name, username, email, phone are required, website is optional
• Username must be longer than 3 characters
• Show validations once the submit button is clicked and update the validations that appear as the
user types
• Assume the server can go down and thus return an error response. We should have a nef alert
component appear in that case as opposed to the inline validation that appears for form validation

Read in the storybook for select, text input and alert so you know how to use them. Use the webcomponents.
